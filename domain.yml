  utter_explain_plan:
  - text: |-
      3G – Available only as prepaid connection. The plan selection is quite limited
      4G – the most successful product, so far, as it offers both prepaid and postpaid connections, for both individual and corporate (bulk) customers. This category has plans for pretty much every class of customers
      5G – anticipated to be the next most successful product. However, due to limited infrastructure across the nation it currently operates in, the plans it offers are rather limited, but more than what it offers under 3G. Both prepaid and postpaid connections are offered. However, the plans are priced higher than in the other two categories.
